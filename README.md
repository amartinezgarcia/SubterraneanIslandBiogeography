Hypotheses
(1) We described the trait space of all the subterranean species in each island. We expected it to converge due to the ecological filter-ing exerted by the colonisation of subterranean habitats, yet exhib-iting a certain degree of variation according to each island's onto-genetic state. (2) We explored how this overall convergence in the trait space might be explained by the different contributions of each species to their overall trait space of islands with different ages. We expected that species contribute progressively less as an island approaches its maximum geological complexity, reflecting increas-ing niche occupancy and a progressive reduction of ecological op-portunity. The contribution of individual species might increase as an island approaches its senescence and extinction reduces its spe-cies richness. (3) We hypothesised that the reduction in species contribution to the total volume of the functional space is a conse-quence of an optimised use of the available niche space driven by species interactions. Under this assumption, we expect that func-tionally similar species will experience a stronger ecological and geographical isolation in mature islands; whereas the distribution of species and their niche occupancy will be more random in se-nescent or young islands (4) We proposed that species interactions might select a non-random combination of traits in each island, leading to trait spaces with smaller volume and higher degree of order in mature islands than those expected by chance from a sam-ple of the archipelago’s species pool.
